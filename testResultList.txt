1- Correct result, Led to finding out that we push the same literal multiple times. Now fixed. 19:24 10.01.24 , runtime = around 0.02 s
2- Correct result, correct assignments and run, runtime = around 0.06 s
3- Correct result ,correct assignments and run, runtime = 0.13 s
4- Correct result, correct assignments and run, runtime = 1.6s
5- Correct result, correct assignments and run, runtime = 0.05s
6- Correct result, correct assignments and run, runtime = 0.05s
7- Correct result, correct assignments and run, runtime = around 0.008s. Lead to seeing that our ClausesToIncrement setup is faulty. If need be we can change it or the if loop can stay.
